songID - When registering a song in the database unique ID will be generated for each song.

List<int[]> peakList - Peaks selected from frequency ranges are stored in peaks array. This consecutive arrays will be added to this list to generate hashes. 
int time - Time value is given for each hash. When a hash is generated time value is incremented and assigned to the hash.
double[] pcm - Pulse Code Modulation data is kept in this array.
String hash - Generated each hash
TreeMap<String, SongInfo> hashMap - SongInfo Object consist of songID and the time value of a hash. Generated hash and respective songInfo object for the hash is added to hashMap treemap.
