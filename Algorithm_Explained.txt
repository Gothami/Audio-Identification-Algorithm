Insertion Algorithm

Variables Explained : 

mp3File - The input to the system is a mp3 file.

songID - When registering a song in the database unique ID will be generated for each song.

int[] peaks - Frequency values which have maximum amplitudes selected from each frequency range will be added to this array. Size of this array will be six since six frequency ranges are chosen.

List<int[]> peakList - Peaks selected from frequency ranges are stored in peaks array. This consecutive arrays will be added to this list to generate hashes. 

int time - Time value is given for each hash. When a hash is generated time value is incremented and assigned to the hash.

double[] pcm - Pulse Code Modulation data is kept in this array.

String hash - Generated each hash

TreeMap<String, SongInfo> hashMap - SongInfo Object consist of songID and the time value of a hash. Generated hash and respective songInfo object for the hash is added to hashMap treemap.

Method Explained :

Decode() - After decoding 512 wise samples will be added to buffers.

Time value will be incremented for each each buffer.

Monophonic() - Buffer data will be converted into monophonic data it there are sterophonic data.
HammingWindow() - Hamming Window is applied to the buffer.
RealFFT() - Time domain data will be converted into frequency domain data using Furior Transformation and Fast Furior Transformation is used.
GetPeaks() - For each buffer, frequencies with highest magnitutes will be selected from six frequency ranges.
GenerateHash() - Using frequencies of four consecutive buffers, one hash is generated.

Generated hash and the SongInfo object which consists of songID and time will be added to the hashMap.

The first peak set will  be removed from the peakList.

After all hashes are generated hashes will be added to the database.
